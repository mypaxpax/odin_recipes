    <h3>Description</h3>
    
    <p>Good old-fashioned meatloaf stands alongside hot dogs and apple pie as iconic American foods. That's not to say any of those dishes actually originated in America, but that hasn't stopped us from embedding them deeply into our culture and lore, and making them our own.</p>
           
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>¼ cup minced onion/li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 pounds extra-lean ground beef</li>
            <li>3 slices bread, toasted and crumbled</li>
            <li>7 buttery round crackers, crushed</li>
            <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>3½ tablespoons sour cream</li>
            <li>1½ tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce, divided</li>
            <li>¼ cup milk, or as needed (Optional)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons ketchup</li>
         </ul>
            <h4>Steps:</h4>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

                <li>Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat, and cook onion and garlic until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and season with salt and pepper.</li>

                <li>Combine onion and garlic mixture, beef, crumbled bread, crushed crackers, egg, sour cream, Worcestershire sauce, and 1/2 can tomato sauce in a large bowl. Mix until well combined. Gradually stir in milk, 1 teaspoon at a time, until mixture is moist, but not soggy. Transfer the mixture to a 5x9 inch loaf pan.</li>

                <li>Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and continue baking 15 minutes, to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>

                <li>Mix the remaining tomato sauce and ketchup in a small bowl. Pour over the top of the meatloaf, and continue baking for 10 minutes.</li>
